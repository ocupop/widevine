                  <p>You can't. Integration of the Widevine client into OEM devices requires a significant amount of time and effort by both the Widevine development team, the OEM manufacture, and both companies legal teams. A device integration is the "root of trust" for the Widevine product and as such must be handled by Widevine. If there is a device you would like to see the Widevine product on, you must encourage the device manufacturer to contact Widevine and request for integration.</p>
